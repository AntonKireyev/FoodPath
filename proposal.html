    <h2>Objective of the Website</h2>
    <p>
      The objective of the website is to provide a comprehensive review of
      restaurants that can be found in and around the Boston area.
    </p>
    <h2>Target Audience</h2>
    <p>
      The target audience would be college students looking for some tasty as
      well as budget friendly options around their campus.
    </p>
    <h2>Content Plan for Each Page</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to the homepage, sitemap, and content/feedback page there will
      be 4 additional pages of content.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h4>Restaurant Ranking</h4>
        <p>
          This page will include the top 3 choices of the month that I have
          personally tried in the past.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Restaurant Map</h4>
        <p>Users will be able to see restaurants that are near them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>"Best" Places to eat</h4>
        <p>
          This page will forego the "budget" considerations and provide lists of
          restaurants that are the best in the category of food.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>Food Trends Page</h4>
        <p>
          This could include data and information regarding market share of
          certain food types or rising popularity of new restaurants in the
          area.
